\section{Build}
\subsubsection{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Configure must discover and include development libraries where possible
    \item Features that have their dependencies met will automatically be built
    \item May be difficult with modules:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item User has to know which modules to load
            \item There are module version requirements
            \item Some modules are in conflict
        \end{itemize}
    \item ../configure must report missing dependencies and fail for features requested with –enable
    \item “make dist” tar file name should  encode major.minor.fix-<git-hash> in the file name : Complete
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Currently the major.minor.fix-``git-hash'' naming comes from the configure.ac
            \item The git hash labeling does not work in all cases
        \end{itemize}
    \item Configure should fail if the git hash cannot be obtained (e.g. building as root in a tree owned by ‘user’): Complete
        
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are a large number of configuration options Have the defaults (no options specified) build all features that are a common subset across supported Linux distributions
        \item Multiple mechanisms are used to implement ‘optional’ features
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \_WITH
                \item \_ENABLE
                \item Env vars
                \item …
            \end{itemize}
        \item Many ‘optional’ features are not actually optional and will break the build if disabled, e.g. python
        \item Need to normalize the way optional features are implemented in configure
        \item Have a ‘what is enabled’ list of plugins/transports/auths dumped at the end of configure output. 
        \item Base OS cython on rhel8 is insufficient (ok on rhel9?). We may be able to influence toss cython default, but other OS’s not in our control.
        \item –disable-* does not work with the libraries that have all the dependencies.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This may occur on a platform with a new compiler set the tree is not tested against.
                \item Autoconf may estimate a compatible dependency library is available when in fact it isn’t.
                \item Build target may lack an external dependency present on the build host. (building extras then forces manual deletion in a packaging or deployment process).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Status}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incomplete
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Assign incomplete Issues to developers
            \end{itemize}
        \item Complete
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Provide a repository to publish user-group content under github : Complete
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
